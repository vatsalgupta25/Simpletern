Bonus tasks:
The following bonus tasks are attempted, although they might not be correct or functioning as expected:
The infrastructure has been created and can be implemented through the terraform file present in the repo.

Another app1.py file is present which has the /metrics endpoint specifically used for the scraping of metrics, 
but due to time constraints, this file is not updated.
prometheus for visualization to grafana.

secret management is done through github secrets, for storing access to Google IAM roles.
rolling deployment is scheduled from Console, for minimum downtime possible.
